# ðŸ’§ Faucet: Driving Higher Conversion Rates in Web3 

This repository contains a CRM-seeding mechanism that constantly watches the social-doxxing endpoints of the public graph found in Web3. Driven by the leaky opsec of high-power individuals, Faucet illustrates the power of social engineering and targeted approaches in Web3.

With growth dominated by the ability to self-align with a product audience, Faucet removes the social moat that exists between a new creator and success. Instead, every person instantly has access to a highly detailed social network without having to do any of the work or time investment.

## ðŸ“š Background

When marketing a product, a targeted approach is often the most effective. This is especially true in Web3 where the social moat is the primary barrier to entry. Faucet is a tool that allows anyone to change their social position by opening the doors of every social network and individual in Web3.

Using the framework and data already released to the public, Faucet serves as a data-aggregator intended to only be used as the starting point.

Before Faucet you could define your audience, but not know who they were. Now, you can define your audience and know exactly who they are in a matter of minutes.
